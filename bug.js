In Next.js, a common yet subtle issue arises when working with dynamic routes and data fetching.  Imagine a scenario where you have a page at `/post/[id]` that fetches data based on the `id` parameter. If your data fetching logic (e.g., using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`) encounters an error, Next.js might not handle it gracefully, potentially leading to a blank page or an unexpected error message.  The problem often stems from insufficient error handling within the data fetching function. For instance, neglecting to catch and handle network errors or database connection issues can result in a broken user experience.
